# HEX/DEC CONVERTER

This is hex/decimal converter that uses a new hexadecimal representation system.

## Why new hex numerals

The most widely used system uses same numbers that are used for 
decimal (0 to 9), and letters A, B, C, D, E, and F completing a total of 16 different symbols. 
This may be good enough for whatever contexts hexadecimal numerals are used for, 
but I think a system that differs slightly from the decimal numerals and from latin 
alphabet would be more appealing and, who knows, maybe even spread adoption of the hexadecimal system.

## Not exactly new

ʘ I Ȥ Ӡ Я V И Ł Λ Ψ X Б Ç Ð Є Ғ

That's right, they are not exactly new. 

+ The 4 first symbols are quite recognizable but slightly different so that even by themselves and without subscripts, we know we are talking about base 16 numbers.
+ The 4 last symbols are just like B, C, D, E, and F, but again slightly different.
+ V and X like 5 and 10 in roman numbers.
+ 7 is just a 7 upside down.
+ Я is a 4 with an extra leg, and you would use 4 strokes to draw it.
+ 6 is like 5 ( V ) but with one more stroke.
+ Λ is 8 because that's the way it is represented in other numerical systems like Urdu, Chinese, Arabic and Hebrew.
+ Ψ is nice.
